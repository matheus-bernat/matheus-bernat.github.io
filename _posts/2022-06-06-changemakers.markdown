### About this project
- Entrepeneurship, development goals, public speaking;
- App and website development in Dart/Flutter.

During the Spring semester 2022, I was selected together with two good friends to participate in the Changemakers program. EPFL Changemakers is a 10-week program for students ready to embark on a great learning journey, boost their innovation and entrepreneurial skills, reflect on their impact, and turn their idea into a real-life project. We won the prize for having made remarkable project development during the program.

*WeFind* is a website gathering Christian youth groups in Switzerland. The advantages of the site is gathering _all_ groups in the same place (even the smaller ones with less budget), and also allowing the groups to easily update the information on the site. The end goal is to help young people find groups that offer moral and spiritual support during their study lives.
