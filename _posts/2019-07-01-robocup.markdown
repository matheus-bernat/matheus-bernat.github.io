### About this project
* Python.
* Google Dialogflow.
* ROS.
* Duration: 2 semesters.

In July 2019 I got the change to travel with 5 other students from Link√∂ping university's robotics association, [FIA](https://fiarobotics.se/index.php/robocup/), to Sydney, Australia, to compete at RoboCup @Home. RoboCup is an annual international robotics competition whose goal is to promote research and interest in 
the fields of robotics and AI. Our team, LiUHomeWreckers, competed in a league called @Home with service robots and reached 4th place out of 7 teams from University of Technology Sydney, University of Chile, etc. 

My role in the team was NLP: I developed the robots hability to talk and understand natural language. I wrote Python
code to interface with the robot's microphone and speakers to collect and send audio packets, and also with Google's 
NLP platform Google Dialogflow to develop the conversations' logic based on the assignments.
