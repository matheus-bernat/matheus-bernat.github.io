### About this project
* Matlab.
* Physical simulation of waves and ship motion.
* Duration: 6 weeks.

I worked on this project during a summer job at [UMS Skeldar](https://umsskeldar.aero/) in Link√∂ping.

This project is part of the collaboration between the competence center LINK-SIC and UMS Skeldar. The final aim of this project was to better understand the motion of ships caused by waves in order to facilitate the landing of multi-rotor aerial vehicles on a moving ship. The achieved mathematical models of waves and ship motion together with the resulting simulations are presented.
