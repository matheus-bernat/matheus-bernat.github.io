### About this project
* Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
* Statistical data analysis.
* Supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Duration: 1 semester (ongoing).

This project was done in the course CS-401 Applied Data Analysis at EPFL.

Starting from the [Quotebank dataset](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf) including 178 million quotations from the English-speaking world, the group's work is to study who has a voice in the media: who they are (profession, age, ethinicity), what they to say, and how they need to say it (sentiment analysis).

This is an ongoing project due the 17th of December, stay tuned for the results!
