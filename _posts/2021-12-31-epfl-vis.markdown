### About this project
* Python, Pytorch.
* ImageNet, WordNet.
* Object classification.
* Duration: 1 semester (ongoing).

This project was done in the course CS-503 [Visual Intelligence: Machines and Minds](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/visual-intelligence-machines-and-minds-CS-503) at EPFL.

We research the role of the architectures of attention and convolution in the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We study models that are purely based on convolution (multi-layer perceptrons), purely based on attention (vision-transformers), and other models that mix both.

See our final presentation in the video below:
