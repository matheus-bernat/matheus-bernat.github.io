### About this project
* Python.
* Pytorch for optimization of positions of cameras and positions of triangulated 3D points.
* 3D reconstruction, structure from motion, epipolar geometry.
* Duration: 6 weeks.

This project was done in the course TSBB15 Computer Vision at Link√∂ping university.

The goal was to construct a system able to perform 3D reconstruction of a static scene given images of this scene takenfrom different angles. This task is thoroughly studied in the field of computer vision and known as Structure from Motion (SfM).
